    "Radiant Environment Maps (REMs, also called \"light-probes\" or \"skydomes\" in different contexts) define the amount of light (radiance) travelling in all directions at a point in the Earth atmosphere. REMs can be computed using libRadtran with the radiance options ('umu' and 'phi') that allow specification of the directions in which one would like to compute the radiance. Most of the solvers in libRadtran can compute radiances, including all the variants of DISORT. One the basic capabilities in MORTICIA is to compute REMs and then to compute (\"render\") the appearance of targets in a specific radiant environment. This notebook illustrates the computation of REMs using libRadtran.\n",
    "\n",
    "libRadtran has a number of k-distribution (also called \"correlated-k\") atmospheric absorption parametrizations. These models allow for more rapid computation of radiances and irradiances, but with limited spectral resolution. One such model for the shortwave spectrum is that by Kato et. al. For the thermal spectrum, there is the Fu parametrization. Read the libRadtran manual for more details. Here, we will use the Kato model to compute the sky/ground appearance as provided by a REM.\n",

    "The MORTICIA class used for REM computation is morticia.rad.librad.RadEnv."
